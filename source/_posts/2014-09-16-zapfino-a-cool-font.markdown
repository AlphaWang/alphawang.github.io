I'm tring to look for some fonts for my blog these days, and find a cool font [`Zapfino`][wiki] inadvertently.  
  
  
Here is how it looks:

Umh... The logo looks pale by comparison, I need to find a more fantastic logo later :)   

Unfortunately, Zapfino is not installed on Windows by default, so I use `Lucida Handwriting` instead. See below:  
![lucida icon](/images/post/2014/09/font-LucidaHandwriting.png)   

The font-family defined in my css is shown below.  
```css css
body > header h1 {   
  padding-left: 45px;   
  font-family: "Zapfino","Snell Roundhand","Lucida Handwriting","PT Serif","Georgia","Helvetica Neue",Arial,serif;
}  
```  

Apprently, this font is suitable for titles, but not contents.   

Here is a blog about web font in more detail: http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2008/06/typography_notes.html    
  
BTW, the history of Zapfino is interesting, the development had become seriously delayed: began from 1944, but released in 1998. Cite from wikiï¼š  
> Zapf remembered a page of calligraphy from his sketchbook from 1944, and considered the possibility of making a typeface from it. ... Siegel also hired Gino Lee, a programmer from Boston, Massachusetts, to help work on the project.

>However, just before the project was completed, Siegel wrote a letter to Zapf, saying that his girlfriend had left him and that he had lost all interest in anything. Siegel abandoned the project and started a new life, working on bringing color to Macintosh computers and later becoming an Internet design expert.

>Zapfino's development had become seriously delayed,... Zapfino was released in 1998 as a Type 1 font.
